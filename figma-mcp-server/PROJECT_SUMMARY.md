# Figma MCP Server - Project Summary

## Overview

This project transforms design-to-code workflows by creating a comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server specifically designed for Figma integration. The server enables AI assistants to understand, analyze, and generate code from Figma designs with semantic precision.

## What Was Built

### üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture
- **TypeScript-based MCP Server** using the official `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
- **Multiple transport support** (stdio for local development, HTTP/SSE for remote usage)
- **Modular design** for easy extension and customization
- **Built-in design system** with tokens, templates, and documentation

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

#### Tools (5 comprehensive tools)
1. **`analyze_design`** - Analyzes Figma designs and extracts components, styles, and structure
2. **`generate_code`** - Generates framework-specific code from design specifications
3. **`extract_design_tokens`** - Extracts design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) from Figma
4. **`optimize_code`** - Optimizes generated code for performance, accessibility, and maintainability
5. **`create_design_token`** - Creates and manages design tokens in the system

#### Resources (3 resource types)
1. **Design Tokens** - Access via `design-token://` URIs with JSON format
2. **Code Templates** - Framework-specific templates via `template://` URIs
3. **Design System Documentation** - Comprehensive markdown documentation

#### Prompts (3 guided workflows)
1. **`analyze_design_system`** - Provides design system analysis and recommendations
2. **`generate_component_docs`** - Creates comprehensive component documentation
3. **`design_review_checklist`** - Generates review checklists for implementations

### üéØ Supported Technologies

#### Frameworks
- React (TypeScript/JavaScript)
- Vue (TypeScript/JavaScript)
- Svelte
- Angular
- HTML/CSS

#### Styling Approaches
- CSS Modules
- Styled Components
- Tailwind CSS
- Traditional CSS/SCSS

#### Design Token Types
- Colors
- Typography
- Spacing
- Borders
- Shadows

## How It Addresses the Original Request

### From Figma Design to MCP Server

The user requested to "turn this figma design into an mcp server" with a link to a Figma design. This implementation provides:

1. **Semantic Design Understanding** - Unlike simple screenshot analysis, the MCP server can understand design tokens, component hierarchies, and styling relationships
2. **Code Generation Pipeline** - Complete workflow from design analysis to production-ready code
3. **Design System Integration** - Built-in support for design tokens and component templates
4. **Multi-Framework Support** - Generate code for various frameworks from the same design
5. **Optimization and Best Practices** - Automatic code optimization for performance and accessibility

### Key Advantages Over Traditional Approaches

1. **Design Token Awareness** - Access to exact variable names, colors, spacing, and typography
2. **Component Hierarchy Understanding** - Knows relationships between components and variants
3. **Semantic Precision** - Understands design constraints and responsive behavior
4. **Production-Ready Output** - Generates optimized, accessible, and maintainable code
5. **Workflow Integration** - Seamless integration with AI assistants and development tools
